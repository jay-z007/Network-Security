1.1 How many packets does the trace contain? 
ANS => The trace contains 32664 packets. We can find that by piping the output of the tcpdump to word count utility wc
COMMAND =>	tcpdump -r  hw1.pcap | wc
OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
  32664  318729 2914570




1.2 How many ARP packets and how many UDP packets?
ANS => There are 11304 ARP packets which can be found by using grep on the tcpdump output or using the 'arp' keyword in tcpdump command
COMMAND => tcpdump -r  hw1.pcap | grep 'ARP' | wc 
OR
tcpdump arp -r hw1.pcap | wc
OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
  11304  101762  884510

ANS => There are 17166 UDP packets which can be found in a similar way by replacing the 'arp' with 'udp' in both commands
COMMAND => tcpdump -r  hw1.pcap | grep 'UDP' | wc
OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
  17166  143103 1391214




1.3 How many packets were exchanged between 192.168.0.200 and 91.189.90.40?
ANS => 28 packets are transferred between the given hosts. The host keyword in the tcpdump 
COMMAND =>  tcpdump host 192.168.0.200 and 91.189.90.40 -r  hw1.pcap | wc
OUTPUT => 
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
     28     588    4834




1.4 Print the unique source IP addresses found in the trace. 
COMMAND => tcpdump -n -r  hw1.pcap | awk '{if ($2=="IP") print $3; else if($3=="Request") print substr($7, 0, length($7)); else print $4}' | awk -F "." '{print $1"."$2"."$3"."$4}' | sort | uniq

Breaking down the above command:
The output of tcpdump is given to 
awk '{if ($2=="IP") print $3; else if($3=="Request") print substr($7, 0, length($7)); else print $4}'
which handles 3 possible cases, IP and ARP request and ARP reply to find the source addresses.
In each case we just print the column of the address ($3, $7, $4)

Then it is followed by
awk -F "." '{$5="";print $1"."$2"."$3"."$4}'
to remove the port number from the ip addresses

and its sorted and unique addresses are printed

OUTPUT =>

1.5 Print the unique private network (according to RFC1918) source IP
 addresses found in the trace. 
ANS => There are 13 unique private network source IP addresses.

The command used is the same as the previous question, with added conditions for the private network ip addresses.

COMMAND => tcpdump -n -r  hw1.pcap | awk '{if ($2=="IP") print $3; else if($3=="Request") print substr($7, 0, length($7)); else print $4}' | awk -F "." '{if ( $1==10 || ($1==172 && $2>=16 && $2<=31) || ($1==192 && $2==168)) print $1"."$2"."$3"."$4}' | sort | uniq |wc

OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
     13      13     165




1.6 Print the unique destination IP addresses found in the trace. 
COMMAND => tcpdump ip -n -r  hw1.pcap | awk  '{print $5;}' | awk 'BEGIN {FS="[.:]"} {print $1"."$2"."$3"."$4}' | sort | uniq

Taking the 5th column in case of IP packets gives us the destination address, then we remove the port number and find the unique addresses after sorting.

1.7 What are the top-5 TCP and top-5 UDP destination ports?
For TCP
COMMAND => tcpdump tcp -n -r  hw1.pcap | awk  '{print $5;}' | awk 'BEGIN {FS="[.:]"} {print $5;}' | sort| uniq -c | sort -n -r | head -5 | awk '{print $2}'

OUTPUT =>

For UDP
COMMAND => tcpdump udp -n -r  hw1.pcap | awk  '{print $5;}' | awk 'BEGIN {FS="[.:]"} {print $5;}' | sort| uniq -c | sort -n -r | head -5 | awk '{print $2}'

OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
1900
137
5355
5353
138




1.8 How many TCP packets have the SYN flag set?
ANS => 75 packets have the SYN flag set
This contains the initial connection attempts (i.e. packets with only SYN flag set) and the reply to the connection request (i.e. packets with SYN and ACK flags set)
COMMAND => tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 2!=0' -n -r hw1.pcap | wc
OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
     75    1636   13385




1.9 How many TCP connection attempts were made?
ANS => 37 connection attempts were made
This only contains the packets with the SYN flag set and no other flag
COMMAND => tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags]==tcp-syn' -n -r hw1.pcap | wc
OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
     37     772    6172




1.10 Towards which ports were TCP connection attempts made? How many attempts
 per port?
ANS => TCP connection attempts were made towards 4 ports : 443, 465, 9100, 80
Number of attempts for each port are :
port 443 - 1
port 465 - 1
port 9100 - 2
port 80 - 33

To calculate this answer, I used the command for the previous question and found the ports in the that result and counted each port in the answer after sorting it.
tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags]==tcp-syn' -n -r hw1.pcap | awk '{print $5}' | awk 'BEGIN{FS="[.:]"} {print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
      1 443
      1 465
      2 9100
     33 80




1.11 How many HTTP GET requests were made? Print the URLs of all HTTP requests
 for JPG files.
ANS => 94 HTTP GET requests were made
COMMAND =>  tcpdump -n -r hw1.pcap | grep "HTTP: GET" | wc -l
OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
94

ANS => 
http://pic.leech.it/i/f166c/479246b0asttas.jpg
/i/f166c/479246b0asttas.jpg
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oZ1XsiOAL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090527/images/459492a-i1.0.jpg
/news/2009/090527/images/459492a-i1.0.jpg

COMMAND =>
tcpdump -n -r hw1.pcap | grep "HTTP: GET" | awk '$(NF-1) ~ /jpg$/ {print $(NF-1)} '

From the output of all the HTTP GET requests, we can compare the second to last column for the presence of "jpg" using a regular expression
From the rows that match the regex the second last column is printed.




1.12 When (date and time) was the first and last packet of the trace sent?
ANS => The first packet of the trace file was sent on 2013-01-12 12:37:42.871346

COMMAND =>
tcpdump -tttt -r hw1.pcap | head -1 | awk '{print $1, $2} '

OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
2013-01-12 12:37:42.871346

ANS => The last packet of the trace file was sent on 2013-01-14 14:27:03.691498

COMMAND =>
tcpdump -tttt -r hw1.pcap | tail -1 | awk '{print $1, $2} '

OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
2013-01-14 14:27:03.691498




1.13 What is the brand of the device that sent most of the packets? What is its
 IP address?
There are two approaches to this answer
1. Finding the most active IP address and then to get its MAC address and then using the first 3 octets of the MAC address we can find the device manufacturer by OUI lookup table. 
ANS => The most sent packets are from a device of brand NETGEAR. Its IP address is 192.168.0.1.

COMMAND => tcpdump -n -r  hw1.pcap | awk '{if ($2=="IP") print $3; else if($3=="Request") print substr($7, 0, length($7)); else print $4}' | awk -F "." '{print $1"."$2"."$3"."$4}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n | head -1

OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
  18374 192.168.0.1

COMMAND =>
tcpdump -e -r hw1.pcap | grep '192.168.0.1' | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'

OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
c4:3d:c7:17:6f:9b

c4:3d:c7 => refers to NETGEAR on OUI lookup table.


2. Finding the most active MAC address and then getting the device name and later finding the IP address for the corresponding MAC address. 
However, in the second approach we find that there are multple IP addresses for the same MAC address.
ANS => The Most packets are sent from a MAC address c4:3d:c7:17:6f:9b which corresponds to NETGEAR. And its IP address is 192.168.0.1

COMMAND =>
tcpdump -e -r hw1.pcap | awk '{print $2, $14}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n | head -1

OUTPUT => 
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
  11025 c4:3d:c7:17:6f:9b 192.168.0.1.1900




1.14 Report the distribution of Ethernet packet sizes (how many packets of size
 X exist in the trace, for all values of X in the trace).
ANS => The left column in the number of packets and the right column in the packet size
COMMAND =>
tcpdump -e -t -n -r hw1.pcap | awk '{print substr($8,0,length($8));}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r

OUTPUT =>
reading from file hw1.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
